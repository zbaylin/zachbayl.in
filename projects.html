          <h2><a href="https://github.com/revery-ui/revery">Revery</a></h2>
          <p>Revery is a cross platform UI framework written in ReasonML/OCaml. I became involved
          in Revery after my good friend and Rolltrax co-founder Ohad Rau recommended I
          contribute to the project. Initially, most of my contributions were about deepening native
          integrations, like notifications, file dialogs, etc. In Summer 2020, I was an intern
          at Outrun Labs, the company behind Revery. During this time, I added numerous features to
          the framework, like <a href="/blog/font-fallback-revery.html">font fallback</a>, drag and
          drop support, and many others.</p>

          <h2><a href="https://github.com/onivim/oni2">Onivim</a></h2>
          <p>Onivim is a modal text editor that aims to bring vim into the 21st century. At the bottom,
            Onivim is a fork of vim called <a href="https://github.com/onivim/libvim"><code>libvim</code></a>.
            The GUI part of Onivim is built using Revery -- in fact, Revery started as the UI layer of the
            second iteration of Oni! I started working on Oni mostly during my Summer 2020 internship at
            Outrun Labs, the developers of Oni. I mostly worked on editor features such as hover, signature
            help, a changelog, etc.

          <h2><a href="https://rolltrax.com">Rolltrax</a></h2>
          <p>I co-founded Rolltrax alongside Ohad Rau and Dr. Brian Patterson in 2017. Our original goal was 
            to create a localized cloud based school attendance system for students who participate in 
            work-based learning programs. This concept quickly ballooned into a full software stack, including
            a website, an API, a desktop app, and a mobile app. Now Rolltrax helps coordinators of work-based 
            learning programs manage attendance, employee evaluations, routine job visit planning, payroll 
            information, and more. I currently serve as the CTO and lead developer, where I am in charge of 
            developing basically every aspect of the software stack (what can I say, our team is small ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)

          <h2><a href="https://github.com/zbaylin/gba_flappybird">gba_flappybird</a></h2>
          <p>This was a project I developed for my CS2110 class. It adapts the famous Flappy Bird
            game by dotGEARS onto the GBA. It is written entirely in C with assets drawn by me. The
            objective of the game is the same as the original: fly through the world without hitting
            any pipes.

          <h2><a href="https://github.com/zbaylin/security-py">SECurity-py</a></h2>
          <p>SECurity-py originally started as a project to fetch quarterly SEC filings from hedge
            funds and analyze trends between quarters. It ended up expanding to other types of
            filings, and now supports Excel output, and can function as an Excel macro itself. 
            My father initially requested this project from me, and it eventually became a fully 
            functional application

          <h2><a href="https://github.com/zbaylin/bookworm">Bookworm</a></h2>
          <p>BookWorm is a project I developed for the FBLA Coding and Programming event in 2019.
            The project description mandated that submissions create a GUI that helps manage the
            distribution of eBooks from librarians to patrons. I chose to write my GUI in Python 
            using the Qt GUI framework, combining the two using the officially supported Qt for
            Python bindings. It supported numerous features, like manager/user stratification, 
            a centralized cloud based backend, PDF DRM generation, and more. It won first place
            at the Georgia FBLA State Leadership Conference, and fifth place at the National 
            Leadership Conference in San Antonio, TX.
