      <i>And other musings about UTF-8/Unicode</i>
      <hr>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>This summer I've had the amazing opportunity to work on Revery/Onivim full time
      as a software intern at Outrun Labs, an experience I'll do a more detailed writeup
      of near the end of the summer.</p>
      <p>One of the goals of the internship was to get font fallback working in Revery
      and Onivim. Font fallback is one of those features that all GUI frameworks nowadays
      simply must have. I'm sure we've all seen the infamous "unknown glyph" mark at least
      once. Seeing Ôøº or ÔøΩ might be passable for an emoji here or there, but it's simply
      unaccpetable if you're expecting to see your native language on the screen.<p>
      
      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>Back in the old days, most digital text was represented in ASCII. As far as text encodings
      go, ASCII is pretty much as simple as it gets -- each character is an 8 bit/1 byte
      integer that corresponds to a character. However, that only leaves us with 2<sup>8</sup>
      or 256 charcters we can represent. If you're only ever writing English/Latin scripts,
      that's more than enough. The probelm with ASCII is its 'A' - "American."</p>

      <p>Eventually UTF-8 and Unicode came along with the ability to represent an arbitrary
      number of characters while still maintaining compatibility with ASCII. Great! Except
      for one thing -- just because Unicode/UTF-8 supports a character doesn't mean any
      given font will contain a glyph for it. Here inlies the problem: <b>barring a very small
      subset, most fonts only have glyphs for one language/script.</b></p>

      <p>As of a couple days ago, if I opened a file in Onivim2 with its default font
      (<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/">JetBrains Mono</a>) and that file happened
      to contain any Japanese characters, this is what would show up:</p>

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="/img/blog/onivim2-no-cjk.png"/>
        <p>Line 132: The string "„Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ„ÄÅÁßÅ„ÅÆÂêçÂâç„ÅØ„Ç∂„ÉÉ„ÇØ„Åß„Åô" should appear.
      </div>

      <p>I should note that as of now, Onivim2 is in it's alpha stage (soon to be beta!),
      so this kind of bug is to be expected. The crux of the issue here is that JetBrains Mono,
      while a great font, does not contain any CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) glyphs. In most
      cases, it's the job of the underlying UI framework to find a font that <i>does</i>
      support these glyphs. Revery should be no different, and the following is how I solved this problem in it.</p>

      <h2>The Solution</h2>
      <p>Luckily we (the Revery team) were far from the first people to encounter this problem.
      Revery's text rendering pipeline looks like this (extremely simplified):</p>

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="/img/blog/revery-text-render-pipeline.svg" />
      </div>

      <p>If you're interested in learning more about Revery's tech stack, the library's creator (and my boss),
      Bryan Phelps, gave this great talk about it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3JqNaw0-Us">here</a>.
      Note that some of Revery's tech has changed since then (namely the inclusion of Skia), but the core
      principles are still the same!</p>

      <p>This is the most simplified case: we already have a typeface loaded into memory
      and it supports all the glyphs we requested from it. In this case, we ask Harfbuzz,
      a text shaping library, to "shape" the text. In the case where the string is 
      "ABC", this is fairly trivial. However, since a single UTF-8 encoded character can
      take up multiple bytes, the shaping utility that Harfbuzz provides cannot be overstated.
      This is especially true in a language like OCaml/ReasonML, where for historical reasons
      (as described above), it's assumed that all characters in a string take up a single byte.</p>

      <p>A sample output from Harfbuzz can be seen below. For demonstation purposes, I chose to
      shape the string "Œ∫œåœÉŒºŒµ" because each character has a different size</p>
<code><pre>-- Œ∫·ΩπœÉŒºŒµ --
- SHAPE: GlyphID: 539 Cluster: 0
- SHAPE: GlyphID: 2690 Cluster: 2
- SHAPE: GlyphID: 305 Cluster: 5
- SHAPE: GlyphID: 541 Cluster: 7
- SHAPE: GlyphID: 304 Cluster: 9
</pre></code>

      <p>Here the glyph ID is the corresponding glyph in the string, and the cluster is the
      <i>byte</i> index of the character in the original string. It may not seem like it, but
      these two components are extremely helpful in implementing a fallback solution.</p>

      <p>First, luckily the standard "unknown" glyph ID for all fonts is 0. If Harfbuzz comes
      across a cluster where the font has no corresponding glyph in the table, it will return the glyph
      ID 0. Let's shape the string "ABCüòÉXYZ"</p>
<code><pre>-- ABCüòÄXYZ --
- SHAPE: GlyphID: 36 Cluster: 0
- SHAPE: GlyphID: 37 Cluster: 1
- SHAPE: GlyphID: 38 Cluster: 2
- SHAPE: GlyphID: 0 Cluster: 3
- SHAPE: GlyphID: 59 Cluster: 7
- SHAPE: GlyphID: 60 Cluster: 8
- SHAPE: GlyphID: 61 Cluster: 9
</pre></code>
      <p>As you can see, where the emoji occurs, the glyph ID is 0 (the font here is Arial).
      For our purposes, we'll call any group of 0-glyphs a <b>hole</b>.</p>

      <p>The next important piece of the puzzle is finding a font that can render that glyph.
      Luckily, Skia provides an API for just that: <code>SkFontMgr::matchFamilyStyleCharacter</code>.
      By simply giving it a font family name (one to most closely match), a character, and
      a locale, we can get a font back that is guaranteed to be able to render that character.
      Awesome, right? Now we can create a basic fallback implementation in pseudocode:</p>

<code><pre>let glyphsAndClusters = Harfbuzz.shape(string);
let result = [];
for each glyph and cluster pair:
  if glyph == 0:
    let typeface = Skia.matchCharacter(...);
    let character = String.utf8CharacterAt(cluster);
    let newGlyph = Harfbuzz.shape(character);
    add(result, newGlyph); 
</pre></code>
      <p>Hooray! It works*!</p>
      
      <div class="figure">
        <img src="/img/blog/initial-font-fallback.png" />
      </div>

      <p>"What's the asterisk for?" you may be wondering. Well, if only it were that simple! Many
      UTF-8 characters you would think of as a single character are actually multiple. For
      instance, all emoji flags are actually the region codes of the country they represent:
      üá∫üá∏ is üá∫ üá∏, üáÆüá± is üáÆ üá±, üáØüáµ is üáØ üáµ , etc. Fun fact: an old bug in Twitter actually
      counted flags as two of your 140 characters! Surely font shaping algorithms have improved
      since then! Anyway, what happens when we try to render one of these flags in Revery?</p>

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="/img/blog/bad-flag-rendering.png"/>
      </div>

      <p>Dang! To be expected, but annoying nonetheless. Alright, how about we try refactoring
      our API to shape holes together? Unfortunately this algorithm is a bit too long to condense
      into easily understandable pseudocode, but if you're curious, you can check out the actual
      implementation <a href="https://github.com/revery-ui/revery/blob/7e726608280470268651abd3dcdd9be133786974/src/Font/FontCache.re#L168-L318">here</a>.
      Basically, we create a recursive function to group all the contiguous holes together, shape
      the substrings that represent the holes, and reassemble the string into an array of shapes.
      Since OCaml lacks first class UTF-8 support, we had to leverage a library called Zed to find
      the UTF-8 bounds in a string. This complicates things a little bit, but luckily Zed's API
      is pretty easy to understand. Let's test that flag again:</p>

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="/img/blog/correct-flag-rendering.png"/>
      </div>

      <p>Success! Although this may be simplistic compared to the fallback algorithms in Blink or
      Gecko, it's not as far off as you might think! In fact, much of the inspiration I got from
      this algorithm came from <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/third_party/blink/renderer/platform/fonts/README.md#text-shaping">
      this incredibly helpful document</a>. There is a lot of corporate boilerplate that complicates
      the actual underlying algorithm in the Blink source, but the core idea is still the same.</p>

      <p>Not only do we get emoji flags, we also get those Japanese characters we couldn't see
      earlier:</p>

      <div class="figure">

      </div>

      <p>Beautiful, if I may say so myself üòé.</p>

      <h2>Special Thanks</h2>
      <p>Although this may not seem that complex, this was one of the largest PRs I've ever written for
      Revery. There were a lot of holes (pun intended) that were exposed when we were expecting UTF-8
      strings to "just work"‚Ñ¢Ô∏è. One of the biggest was text wrapping. One of my good friends (the one who introduced me
      to Revery in the first place), <a href="https://ohad.space">Ohad Rau</a>, wrote the text wrapping
      algorithm initially, and he was extremely helpful in my quest to get the algorithm UTF-8 compliant.</p>
      
      <p>I also want to thank <a href="https://github.com/bryphe">Bryan Phelps</a> and 
      <a href="https://github.com/glennsl">Glenn Slotte</a> for some algorithm suggestions and improvements.
      Both of them have been immensely helpful not only for this feature, but the entire summer. I've learned
      so much during this summer, and I'm incredibly grateful to Bryan for giving me this opportunity.</p>
